 Business-Focused Post-Model Steps

  1. Business Impact Assessment

  # Calculate financial impact of your model
  analyze_false_negatives(model, X_test, y_test)  # How much money are we losing?
  plot_precision_recall_thresholds(model, X_test, y_test, min_recall=0.8)  # What's the cost-benefit?

  2. Stakeholder Communication

  # Create visualizations for executives/loan officers
  confusion_matrix_analysis(results, X_test, y_test)  # Simple performance overview
  plot_feature_importance(results, ensemble, X_train)  # What drives defaults?

  3. Actionable Business Insights

  # Find patterns loan officers can use
  patterns = discover_default_patterns(df, 'Current_loan_status')  # Risk factors to watch
  explain_with_shap(model, X_test.sample(100), model_type='tree')  # Why customers default

  4. Model Deployment Readiness

  # Ensure model will work in production
  overfitting_check(model, beta, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, X_test, y_test)

  Key Business Questions to Answer:

  1. "How much money will this model save us?" → Use false negative analysis
  2. "What should loan officers look for?" → Use feature importance + SHAP
  3. "Can we trust this model?" → Use overfitting check + confusion matrix
  4. "What's the optimal approval threshold?" → Use precision-recall curves

  Jupyter Notebook Structure:

  ## 1. Model Performance Summary (for executives)
  ## 2. Financial Impact Analysis (cost of missed defaults)
  ## 3. Key Risk Factors Discovered (actionable insights)
  ## 4. Model Reliability Check (trust/confidence)
  ## 5. Implementation Recommendations
