1. "How much money will this model save us?"

Use: confusion_matrix_analysis() + Manual Financial Calculation
# Get confusion matrix results
confusion_matrix_analysis(results, X_test, y_test)

# From the confusion matrix, extract:
# TP = True Positives (correctly identified defaults)
# FN = False Negatives (missed defaults)
# FP = False Positives (good customers rejected)
# TN = True Negatives (correctly approved)

# Calculate financial impact
avg_loan_amount = 15000
recovery_rate = 0.20
profit_margin = 0.05

cost_of_missed_defaults = FN_count √ó avg_loan_amount √ó (1 - recovery_rate)
value_of_prevented_defaults = TP_count √ó avg_loan_amount √ó (1 - recovery_rate)
lost_profit_from_rejections = FP_count √ó avg_loan_amount √ó profit_margin

net_savings = value_of_prevented_defaults - cost_of_missed_defaults - lost_profit_from_rejections

2. "Why is our model missing certain defaults?"

Use: analyze_false_negatives_misleading_features()
# Understand which features mislead the model
misleading_analysis = analyze_false_negatives_misleading_features(model, X_test, y_test)
Business Output: "Model misses defaults because customers have good credit scores but high debt-to-income ratios"

3. "What should loan officers look for?"

Use: discover_default_patterns() + explain_with_shap()
# Get actionable patterns
patterns = discover_default_patterns(X_data=X_test, y_data=y_test,
                                    model=model, use_model_importance=True)

# Get model decision explanations
explain_with_shap(model, X_test.sample(100), model_type='tree')

4. "How do we reduce false negatives?"

Use: analyze_false_negatives_misleading_features() + threshold adjustment
# Identify misleading features
misleading_features = analyze_false_negatives_misleading_features(model, X_test, y_test)

# Adjust threshold to catch more defaults
plot_precision_recall_thresholds(model, X_test, y_test, min_recall=0.90)  # Higher recall

The analyze_false_negatives_misleading_features() function is perfect for understanding why your model fails on
certain defaults, which helps improve loan officer training and model refinement.

1. "How much money will this model save us?"

Use: analyze_false_negatives() + Manual Calculation
# Step 1: Get false negative analysis
fn_analysis = analyze_false_negatives(model, X_test, y_test)

# Step 2: Calculate financial impact
avg_loan_amount = 15000  # Your average loan size
recovery_rate = 0.20     # Typically 20% recovered from defaults

# Missed defaults cost = FN_count √ó avg_loan_amount √ó (1 - recovery_rate)
missed_defaults_cost = fn_count √ó 15000 √ó 0.80

# Prevented defaults value = TP_count √ó avg_loan_amount √ó (1 - recovery_rate)
prevented_defaults_value = tp_count √ó 15000 √ó 0.80

net_savings = prevented_defaults_value - missed_defaults_cost

2. "What should loan officers look for?"

Use: discover_default_patterns() + explain_with_shap()
# Get actionable risk factors
patterns = discover_default_patterns(
    X_data=X_test, y_data=y_test,
    model=best_model, use_model_importance=True
)

# Get model explanations for specific cases
explain_with_shap(model, X_test.sample(100), model_type='tree')
Business Output: "Focus on customers with debt consolidation loans, renters, and income-to-loan ratios > 0.4"

3. "Can we trust this model?"

Use: overfitting_check() + confusion_matrix_analysis()
# Check model reliability
reliability = overfitting_check(model, beta, X_train, y_train, X_val, y_val, X_test, y_test)

# Visualize performance
confusion_matrix_analysis(results, X_test, y_test)
Business Output: "Model shows consistent 85% accuracy across all datasets - safe to deploy"

4. "What's the optimal approval threshold?"

Use: plot_precision_recall_thresholds()
# Find business-optimal threshold
plot_precision_recall_thresholds(model, X_test, y_test, min_recall=0.8)

# Calculate profit at different thresholds
thresholds = [0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7]
for threshold in thresholds:
    y_pred_custom = (model.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1] >= threshold).astype(int)
    # Calculate profit = approved_loans √ó profit_margin - defaults √ó loss_rate

5. "Which customer segments are riskiest?"

Use: Enhanced discover_default_patterns()
# Segment analysis by demographics
patterns = discover_default_patterns(
    df[['loan_intent', 'home_ownership', 'person_age_group', 'Current_loan_status']],
    'Current_loan_status'
)
Business Output: "Debt consolidation loans have 45% default rate vs 12% for home improvement"

6. "How do we explain rejections to customers?"

Use: explain_with_shap() for individual cases
# For rejected customer at index 0
explain_with_shap(model, X_rejected_sample, sample_idx=0)
Business Output: "Your application was declined due to high debt-to-income ratio (60% vs recommended 30%)"

7. "Is the model getting worse over time?"

Use: plot_learning_curve() + periodic revalidation
plot_learning_curve(model, X_current_month, y_current_month, "Monthly Performance")

# Executive Summary Function
def create_business_summary(model, X_test, y_test, avg_loan_amount=15000):

    # 1. Financial Impact
    fn_analysis = analyze_false_negatives(model, X_test, y_test)
    cost_savings = calculate_savings(fn_analysis, avg_loan_amount)

    # 2. Key Risk Factors
    patterns = discover_default_patterns(X_data=X_test, y_data=y_test,
